                    <li>Sign in using your email address (you now do not have to remember a separate WhyJustRun username)</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>How does this change impact you?</h3>
                <p>Instead of signing in with your old username, <strong>$username</strong>, you should now sign in with your email address when using WhyJustRun: <strong>$email</strong>. Your password will be unchanged.</p>
                
                <p>If you have any questions, you can email Russell Porter for support at contact@russellporter.com</p>
